# OpenEVmap

**OpenEVmap** is an open-source tool for mapping and maintaining EV charging stations in OpenStreetMap.

It helps contributors, EV operators, and developers add and edit EV charging infrastructure data correctly, consistently, and with respect to the OpenStreetMap ecosystem.

---

## 🌍 What is OpenEVmap?

OpenEVmap is a web-based interface that simplifies working with EV charging stations in **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**.

The project focuses exclusively on electric vehicle charging infrastructure and aims to improve the quality, accuracy, and completeness of EV-related data in OSM.

OpenEVmap does **not** create a separate or closed database.  
All edits are made directly to OpenStreetMap.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Make EV charging infrastructure data in OpenStreetMap:
- accurate,
- up to date,
- easy to contribute to,
- useful for everyone.

---

## ✨ Key principles

- **Open-first**  
  All data belongs to OpenStreetMap.

- **OSM-friendly**  
  Built with respect for OSM rules, tagging practices, and community standards.

- **EV-focused**  
  Only electric vehicle charging infrastructure — no generic POIs.

- **Low barrier to entry**  
  Accessible to non-expert mappers and EV operators.

- **No vendor lock-in**  
  OpenEVmap is tooling, not a data silo.

---

## 🧩 Features (planned & in progress)

- OAuth login via OpenStreetMap
- Create new EV charging stations (POI)
- Edit existing charging stations
- Guided EV-specific tagging (connectors, power, access, payment, operator)
- Validation to prevent common tagging mistakes
- Change preview before submitting edits
- Source attribution support
- Minimal, focused UI for EV mapping

---

## 🔐 Authentication

OpenEVmap uses OpenStreetMap OAuth for authentication.

Users edit data under their own OSM account.
All changes are transparent and fully traceable in OSM history.

---

## 🗺️ Why OpenEVmap exists

Mapping EV charging stations directly in OpenStreetMap is powerful — but often complex and error-prone.

OpenEVmap exists to:
- reduce incorrect tagging,
- prevent duplicate POIs,
- help EV operators contribute clean data,
- improve downstream EV apps that rely on OSM.

---

## 🧠 Relationship to commercial products

OpenEVmap is an **open, community-oriented project**.

It is developed alongside a commercial EV product, but:
- OpenEVmap itself is not a closed or paid service
- it does not restrict access to data
- it improves shared infrastructure for everyone

Commercial products may build **on top of** improved OSM data, but OpenEVmap always pushes data back to OSM.

---

## 🚧 Project status

Early development / MVP stage.

Initial focus:
- core editing flow
- correct EV tagging
- safe OSM integration

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome:
- code
- UX feedback
- OSM tagging expertise
- testing in different regions

More contribution guidelines coming soon.

## 📄 License

TBD (likely MIT or similar permissive license)
